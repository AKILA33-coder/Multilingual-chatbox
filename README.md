# 🎭 ECHO – The Multimodal Emotional Intelligence Engine

ECHO is an AI-powered multimodal emotion recognition system that analyzes **text and voice inputs** to understand human emotions more accurately.  
Unlike traditional sentiment analysis systems that rely only on text, ECHO combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Audio Signal Processing** to detect emotions in a human-like manner.

## 🧩 System Architecture

1. User inputs text or audio  
2. Text is processed using NLP & Transformer models  
3. Audio is analyzed using acoustic features (pitch, tone, frequency)  
4. Emotion scores are combined using weighted fusion  
5. Emotion is classified and visualized  
6. Personalized suggestions are generated
